<h1>The Best Series According to Lelabi</h1>
<h2>My Top 5 Picks</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Big Bang Theory</h3>
<p>This one rocked! I really enjoyed the bond between the girls and their science nerds</p>
<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>I've still been unable to recover from this one</p>
<h3>Blackish</h3>
<p>If I had my way, there'd be more eight seasons because wow! what a beautiful blend of comedy and culture</p>
<h3>The Chosen</h3>
<p>The best reenactment of the life of Jesus Christ that I've ever seen. A true masterpiece and a gift from God to reach out to the lost</p>
<h3>Bridgerton</h3>
<p>I'll admit it; I didn't enjoy this one at first watvh but i gave it a second chance and I'm so glad i did. Can't wait for season 3!</p>
